## What's `tmle3shift`?

`tmle3shift` is an adapter/extension R package in the `tlverse` ecosystem that
exposes support for the estimation of a target parameter defined as the mean
counterfactual outcome under a posited shift of the natural value of a
continuous-valued intervention, using the formalism of stochastic treatment
regimes. As an adapter package, `tmle3shift` builds upon the core `tlverse`
grammar introduced by `tmle3`, a general framework that supports the
implementation of a range of TMLE parameters through a unified interface. For a
detailed description of the target parameter, TML estimator, and algorithm
implemented in `tmle3shift`, the interested reader is invited to consult
@diaz2012population and @diaz2018stochastic. For a general discussion of the
framework of targeted minimum loss-based estimation and the role this
methodology plays in statistical and causal inference, the canonical references
are @vdl2011targeted and @vdl2018targeted.

Building on the original work surrounding the TML estimator for the
aforementioned target parameter, `tmle3shift` additionally implements a set of
techniques for variable importance analysis, allowing for a sequence of mean
counterfactual outcomes, estimated under a sequence of posited shifts, to be
summarized via a working marginal structural model (MSM). The goal of this work
is to build upon the `tlverse` framework and the estimation methodology
implemented for a single mean counterfactual outcome in order to introduce an
end-to-end methodology for variable importance analyses.
